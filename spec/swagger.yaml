  title: Flat API
  description: |
    The Flat API allows you to easily extend the abilities of the [Flat Platform](https://flat.io), with a wide range of use cases including the following:

    * Creating and importing new music scores using MusicXML or MIDI files
    * Browsing, updating, copying, exporting the user's scores (for example in MP3, WAV or MIDI)
    * Managing educational resources with Flat for Education: creating & updating the organization accounts, the classes, rosters and assignments.

    The Flat API is built on HTTP. Our API is RESTful It has predictable resource URLs. It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors. It also accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body.
    The [schema](/swagger.yaml) of this API follows the [OpenAPI Initiative (OAI) specification](https://www.openapis.org/), you can use and work with [compatible Swagger tools](http://swagger.io/open-source-integrations/).
    This API features Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) implemented in compliance with [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/).

    You can use your favorite HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Flat's API. This specification and reference is [available on Github](https://github.com/FlatIO/api-reference).

    These API endpoints are related to the Flat account you are currently using. When using an OAuth2 access token, you can use [`GET /me`](#operation/getAuthenticatedUser) to get information about the account.

  x-displayName: Music scores
  description: |
    Sheet music is the main API object type available for all Flat account.

    Here is a typical lifecycle for a music score document on Flat:
      - An end user can **create a music score** or **import a document** using our [web interface](https://flat.io) or a third-party website/app (e.g. Google Drive) using this API (see [`POST /v2/scores`](#operation/createScore). The creation and import of music scores can be done with this single API endpoint. This one currently supports the [MusicXML](http://www.musicxml.com/) (compressed or not) and [MIDI](https://www.midi.org/specifications).
      - The scores from a single account can **be listed** with [`GET /users/{user}/scores`](#operation/getUserScores) as well of scores shared with a specific group with [`GET /groups/{group}/scores`](#operation/getGroupScores).
      - The metadata of a single score can be retrieved with [`GET /scores/{score}`](#operation/getScore).
      - Scores on Flat have **one or multiple revisions**: creating a new score will create a first revision. These **revisions can be listed** using [`GET /scores/{score}/revisions`](#operation/getScoreRevisions) and a specific **revision data can be downloaded** with [`GET /scores/{score}/revisions/{revision}/{format}`](#operation/getScoreRevisionData). New revisions can be created using our [sheet music editor](https://flat.io) or using [`POST /scores/{score}/revisions`](#operation/createScoreRevision) (this endpoint has similar parameters than during the score creation). The last revision of a document may not directly reflect the really last version of a music score: recent modifications can be made offline or not yet consolidated into a new revision. In average, a new revision is created every 100 modifications made with our editor.
      - Scores can be **shared publicly** by changing the privacy option with [`POST /scores/{score}`](#operation/editScore), or **individually shared** using the different collaborators API endpoints (see [`POST /scores/{score}/collaborators`](#operation/addScoreCollaborator)).

        When creating a class, Flat automatically creates two groups: one for the teachers of the course, one for the students. The creator of this class is automatically added to the teachers group.

        If the classsroom is synchronized with another application like Google Classroom, some of the meta information will automatically be updated.

        You can add users to this class using `POST /classes/{class}/users/{user}`, they will automatically added to the group based on their role on Flat. Users can also enroll themselves to this class using `POST /classes/enroll/{enrollmentCode}` and the `enrollmentCode` returned in the `ClassDetails` response.

  ScorePrivacy:

      The score main privacy mode.

      - `public`: The score is public on the Internet. This one can be accessible at the url `https://flat.io/score/{score}` and can be modified and administred by specified collaborators users.
      - `private`: The score is private and can be only accessed, modified and administred by specified collaborators users.
      - `privateLink`: The score is private but can be accessed using a private link `htmlUrl` or the private key in the property `sharingKey`.
      - `organizationPublic`: _Available only with [Flat for Education](https://flat.io/edu)._ The score is public in the organization: users of the same organization can access to this one. The score can be modified and administred by specified collaborators users.

      The score can also be individually shared to a set of users or groups using the different collaborators API methods.

      When a file is synchronized from an external source (e.g. Google Drive) and the sharing options are changed on the source, Flat will chose the best privacy mode for the file.

      When using a [Flat for Education](https://flat.io/edu) account, some of the modes may not be available if disabled by an administrator of the organization (e.g. by default the `public` mode is not available).
